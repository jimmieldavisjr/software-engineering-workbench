#
# TUPLE
# ----------------
#
# 1. Immutable:
#       - Once created, elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
#
# 2. Ordered:
#       - Preserves the order in which elements are defined.
#
# 3. Indexable:
#       - Supports zero-based indexing for retrieving values.
#
# 4. Heterogeneous:
#       - Can store different data types in the same tuple.
#
# 5. Hashable (when all elements are immutable):
#       - Can be used as a dictionary key or stored in a set.
#
# 6. Supports Unpacking:
#       - Allows multiple variables to be assigned from tuple elements.
#
# 7. Defined by Commas:
#       - Parentheses are optional; commas create the tuple structure.
#
# 8. Lightweight and Efficient:
#       - More memory-efficient and faster than lists for read-only data.
